<div align="center">

</div>

This app is built using Streamlit and provides interactive coding and multiple-choice question practice for machine learning and deep learning topics. It is designed to help interview candidates practice key concepts, algorithms, and techniques by generating coding challenges and questions on-demand.

## Features

- **Coding Practice**
  - Choose from a list of top ML and DL algorithms and concepts (e.g., Linear Regression, K-Means, Self Attention). #TODO: Add more algorithms and concepts, perhaps add a free flowing text field
  - Set a coding intensity level to determine how much of the code you want to write yourself (from 0% to 100%).
  - Choose to implement the algorithm from scratch or using standard libraries (e.g., `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms).
  - Receive generated code from a Large Language Model (LLM) that matches the selected intensity level.
  - Edit, run, and test the code directly in the Streamlit app, mimicking an IDE-like experience.
  - Use "Explain This Code" to get a detailed explanation of the code.

- **Multiple Choice Questions**
  - Select the number of questions and difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard).
  - Practice answering multiple-choice questions generated by an LLM on the selected topic.
  - Get instant feedback on answers with color-coded results.
  - Review your final score at the end of each quiz.
  - Request explanations for questions to deepen your understanding.

- **New Features**
  - Improved code syntax highlighting
  - Safer code execution environment
  - Better error handling for LLM responses
  - Configurable settings via environment variables
  - Enhanced UI with responsive design

## Installation

To set up and run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/analyticsbot/deep-learning.git
    cd ai-ml-code-interviewer
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. First, create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    # Create virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the settings as needed:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file to configure your LLM API keys based on which provider you want to use:

   ```
   # For OpenAI
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

   # For Anthropic
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here

   # For Google Gemini
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key_here

   # For Grok
   GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_key_here
   ```

   **IMPORTANT**: The `.env` file contains sensitive API keys and should NEVER be committed to version control. It is already included in the [.gitignore](/ai-ml-code-interviewer/.gitignore) file. DO NOT remove it from [.gitignore](/ai-ml-code-interviewer/.gitignore) as this would expose your API keys to others.

   All other configuration settings (LLM_PROVIDER, LLM_BASE_URL, LLM_MODEL, LLM_TEMPERATURE) are stored in the [.app_settings.json](/ai-ml-code-interviewer/.app_settings.json) file, which is safe to commit as it does not contain any sensitive information.

   **WARNING**: NEVER share your `.env` file or commit it to any public repository. Always keep it secure and private.

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### LLM Server Issues

- Ensure your LM Studio server is running at the configured endpoint, if you're using the local server
- For the LLM such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini, verify API key is configured in the `.env` file
